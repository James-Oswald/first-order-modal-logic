* Modals qualify the truth of a judgement
* Modals capture what linguists refer to as "tense"
"mood" and "aspect".
* Modals act as adverbials in language
* Modals qualify the predicate or qualify the truth of the claim. 

1) Is "probably" a modal? 

"Probably" is a modal. It is mentioned as a one by Isaac Watts in the paragraph 3 quote and meets the criteria of qualifying the truth of the claim.

2) Is "truly" a modal?

I argue "truly" is not a modal. It does not qualify truth it merely expresses that what it is modifying is true, IE acts as the identity function for truth on its predicate. IE the truth value of "John is happy" is the same as "John is truly happy", therefore it does not qualify the predicate or qualify the truth
of the claim.

3) Is "needless to say" a modal?

I argue "needless to say" is not a modal by the same reasoning used with truly. "John is needless to say happy" truth-value wise is the same judgement as "John is happy".

4) Is "not" a modal

While "not" is truth functional, I would say it is a modal based on its ability to qualify the predicate, "John is not happy" has not explicitly modify the truth value of the predicate, even if its merely by negating it.
